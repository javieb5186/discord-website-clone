# Discord Website Clone

A responsive, animated clone of the Discord **marketing website** (not the app), built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [MUI](https://mui.com/).  
This project showcases complex CSS implementation, depth layering with smart z-indexing, smooth scroll-based animations, video integration, and mobile responsiveness.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this project was to explore complex, beautiful CSS patterns I hadnâ€™t worked with before.  
Other goals were to improve my skills with TypeScript and experiment with new libraries in a realistic frontend setting.

## Highlights

- **Next.js for Performance & Routing**: Uses Next.js for fast rendering, route-based code splitting, and SEO-friendly architecture.
- **Complex Custom CSS**: Manually crafted layered layouts, fine-tuned responsiveness, and precise animations using plain CSS with MUI.
- **Basic Login System**: Simulates authentication flow with reusable UI components.
- **Animations & Transitions**: Scroll-triggered animations and fluid UI transitions.
- **Custom Carousel**: Fully custom-built React carousel (not from a library), with smooth transitions and responsiveness.
- **Device Detection**: Leverages `react-device-detect` to tailor user experiences based on device type (e.g., rendering different layouts or interactions for mobile vs. desktop).
- **Smart Z-Indexing**: Layered components for visual hierarchy and depth.
- **Fully Responsive**: Optimized for desktop and mobile with flexible layouts.
- **Multimedia Integration**: Videos and images to match the feel of the original Discord site.
